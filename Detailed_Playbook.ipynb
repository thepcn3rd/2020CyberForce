    "A major difference this year from previous years is red team can only give you points and\n",

    "We're using the \"assume breach\" model, so it's expected that red will be on your systems\n",
    "and you will not be penalized for it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you will be given clear instructions on specific detection, mitigation, and recovery\n",
    "actions that will earn you points. Think about it - how can you recover from an attack \n",
    "unless it's successful? It's a chicken and egg problem. So we create the successful attack\n",
    "and will only score you based on our instructions for recovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "The red team is not allowed to overwhelm you. After each scoring event, the red team will \n",
    "stop and give you specific defensive actions to carry out for points. Red will not execute\n",
    "another attack until the timing window for the next scored event. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is that understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "All points can only be assigned through this chat. If there are other activities on your\n",

    "affect your score. Remember, points can only be received if communicated through the chat.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not kill processes or connections unless directed through the scoring chat. Otherwise, \n",

    "This is for the purpose of emulating a junior system administrators doing their duties.\n",

    "If we do not hear from you within 20 mins., then that event will be marked as declined\n",
    "and you will received 0 points for it. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For some events, you might have already patched the intended vector of the attack. In these\n",

    "\n",
    "What was your technique for solving, what tools did you use, output of commands, submitting\n",
